    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      I was hired to "document and resolve the security and privacy issues in
      a working Node.js + Express + MongoDB web application" which may be
      found
      <a href="https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/entry.html">here</a>
      . It is a website and server that lets user login with a name, latitude,
      and longitude and allows other users to check on the data
      <a href="https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/">here</a>
      .      
    </p>

    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    <p>
      I conducted black-box testing with the Burp Suite tool.
    </p>

    <h1>Abstract Findings</h1>
    <p>
      I found that the service not checking user input allows malicious actors
      to affect other user's experiences with the site including popups,
      images, and videos. 
    </p>

    <h1>Issues Found</h1>
    <h3>Cross-Site Scripting</h3>
    <p>Issue: Cross-Site Scripting</p>
    <p>Location: https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/entry.html</p>
    <p>
      Severity: This is a high severity issue because it allows tampering
      with other user's experiences.</p>
    <p>Examples and Evidence: </p>
    <img src="./ex_code.jpg" alt ="" height="500" width="500"/> 
    <img src="./ex_popup.jpg" alt ="" height="500" width="500"/> 
    <img src="./ex_main.jpg" alt ="" height="500" width="500"/>
    <p>
      I found this issue by intercepting data with Burp Suite and modifying data to
      hold HTML code that held Javascript code. Examples of possibly inserted code:
    </p>
    <xmp>
      <script>alert('You done gone and got hacked boi.');</script>
    </xmp>
    <p>
      Resolution: Just as the user's latitude and longitude are validated, the user's
      login should be validated to make sure that it does not contain harmful code.
      Example of how to do this: 
    </p>
    <xmp>
      function bad( login) {
          if(login.indexOf('<') > -1) {
              return true;
          }
	  if(login.indexOf('>') > -1) {
              return true;
          }
          return false;
      }
    </xmp>
    
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
      Beyond previous suggestions, I would also suggest that application
      uses the browser's information for latitude and longitude so that a
      user can not lie about their position via the online form.
      Making the recommended change should take no more than 15 minutes
      and cost no more than $25.
